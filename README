MLP abstracted origin fractional filter and assembly phases into classes, making the project more OOP.
New MLP class is added as the front api for process control.
Under ./Bin/ directory, run the project as following:

sh build_run_MLP.sh

Raw data is needed in ./data/, 3 files required:
1. paras.txt - parameters of MLP
2. nodes_all - sw node file
3. links - sw link file

* Details about input files can be found under ./data/
* Default output path is ./result/
